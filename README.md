# CodeScanner

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

This project demonstrates basic capabilities of the React Native framework built with Expo Go. In the future this project will become the basis of a product barcode scanning app allowing users to discover more information about the products they purchase.

Uses:
- Expo Router for navigation
- Expo Camera for camera and barcode scanning

- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## Scanning codes

1. Navigate to Camera tab and allow permission for Expo to use the camera
2. Hold camera in front of any bar/QR code
3. A modal will pop up showing the data scanned from the code
